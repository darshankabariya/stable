# Stablecoin Arbitrage Bot on Ethereum L2

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a bot that performs arbitrage trading of stablecoins on the Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network. The bot will monitor price discrepancies across different exchanges and execute trades to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities, potentially earning a few dollars every minute.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously track stablecoin prices across multiple exchanges on the Ethereum L2 network.
- **Automated Trading**: Execute trades automatically when arbitrage opportunities are detected.
- **Profit Optimization**: Optimize trade execution to maximize profit while minimizing transaction costs.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high-frequency trading with minimal latency.

## Technology Stack

- **Ethereum L2**: Utilize Layer 2 solutions for faster and cheaper transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Implement smart contracts to facilitate secure and automated trading.
- **Node.js/Python**: Backend development for bot logic and exchange integration.
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js**: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
